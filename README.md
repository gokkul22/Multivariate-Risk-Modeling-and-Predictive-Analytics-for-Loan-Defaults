# Multivariate-Risk-Modeling-and-Predictive-Analytics-for-Loan-Defaults

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan default risk for the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform. By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, the project identifies key drivers behind loan defaults and builds predictive models to assist in decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Lending Club, as a financial platform, faces significant risks when lending money to applicants who may default. The objective of this project is to analyze historical data of borrowers and loans to:
	1.	Understand the factors contributing to loan defaults.
	2.	Build predictive models to classify borrowers into high-risk and low-risk categories.
	3.	Optimize lending decisions to minimize financial losses while maintaining business goals.
